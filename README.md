## Why Choose WelsonJS?
WelsonJS is an advanced JavaScript framework designed to operate in extreme conditions where conventional solutions may fail. Unlike traditional JavaScript frameworks, WelsonJS focuses on executing scripts in constrained environments, ensuring reliable performance even with minimal system resources.

### Key Features
* **Lightweight and Efficient**: Optimized for environments with limited computing power, WelsonJS delivers efficient script execution without unnecessary overhead.
* **Windows ECMAScript Compatibility**: Designed to run seamlessly on Windows-based systems, adhering to the ECMAScript standard while maintaining lightweight execution.
* **Standalone Execution**: Unlike well-known JavaScript runtimes, which require external dependencies, a WelsonJS application can operate as a self-contained app, making it suitable for embedded systems and isolated environments.
* **Security-Oriented**: Built with security in mind, ensuring controlled execution of scripts without compromising system integrity.
* **Minimalist Design**: WelsonJS strips away unnecessary complexities, focusing on core functionalities that maximize performance and reliability.

### Use Cases
* **Legacy System Integration**: WelsonJS provides a practical solution for running JavaScript on older Windows environments where modern frameworks are not feasible.
* **Automation and Scripting**: Ideal for executing scripts in constrained environments, enabling automated workflows and system-level scripting.
* **Embedded Applications**: Suitable for devices and systems with strict resource constraints, such as industrial controllers and embedded platforms.
* **Security-Focused Environments**: Useful in security-sensitive applications where dependencies on external network connections are limited.
* **Office Automation**: Suitable for office automation tasks using Microsoft Office and various LLM-based AI (such as ChatGPT).

WelsonJS is tailored for developers who need a reliable, lightweight JavaScript framework in environments where traditional solutions are impractical. Whether working with legacy systems, embedded devices, or security-critical applications, WelsonJS ensures that JavaScript remains a viable and efficient option.

## Quick start

### 1. Write a file `lib/sayhello.js`
```js
// lib/sayhello.js
function say() {
    console.log("hello");
}

exports.say = say;

exports.VERSIONINFO = "SayHello (sayhello.js) version 0.1";
exports.AUTHOR = "abuse@catswords.net";
exports.global = global;
exports.require = global.require;
```

### 2. Write a file `sayhello.js`
```js
// sayhello.js
var SayHello = require("lib/sayhello");

function main() {
    console.log("calling say()");
    SayHello.say();
    console.log("ended say()");
}

exports.main = main;
```

### 3. Execute script on the console
```cmd
C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents\GitHub\welsonjs> cscript app.js sayhello
calling say()
hello
ended say()
```

## How to release my application?
The WelsonJS framework suggests the following application release methods:

- **Compress to Zip, and use the launcher**: Compress the files and directories necessary for running the project into a Zip file, and distribute it along with the [WelsonJS Launcher](https://catswords-oss.rdbl.io/5719744820/4131485779).
- **Build a setup file**: Use [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). The setup profile (the `setup.iss` file) is already included.
- **Copy all directories and files**: This is the simplest and most straightforward method.
